## New CausalIQ repo creation

This section provides instructions for **creating a completely new CausalIQ repo** which offers a **new capability**. This capability will be referred to as "newcapability" in the following instructions below, but should in practice be a word which meaningfully summarises the capability e.g. "pipeline" or "score".

### Prerequisites

- Git 
- Latest stable versions of Python 3.9, 3.10. 3.11 and 3.12

### Create the new repo on GitHub

- Create the [new repo on Github](https@//github.com/new) with name causaliq-newcapability specifying **this repository (i.e. causaliq-repo-template) as the template**. Fill in the description of the repo. The commit will have a default message of "Initial Commit"

### Clone the new repo locally and check that it works

Clone the causaliq-newcapability repo locally as normal

```bash
git clone https://github.com/causaliq/causaliq-newcapability.git
```

Set up the Python virtual environments and activate the default Python virtual environment. You may see
messages from VSCode (if you are using it as your IDE) that new Python environments are being created
as the scripts/setup-env runs - these messages can be ignored.

```text
scripts/setup-env -Install
scripts/activate
```

Check that the causaliq-repo-template CLI is working, check that all CI tests pass, and start up the local mkdocs webserver. There should be no errors  reported in any of these.

```text
causaliq-repo-template --help
scripts/check_ci
mkdocs serve
```

Enter **http://127.0.0.1:8000/** in a browser and check that the 
causaliq-repo-template skeleton documentation is visible.

If all of the above works, this confirms that the code from the template repo is working successfully on your system.

### Change all references in package to new package name

In the IDE (e.g. VSCode) editor make the following GLOBAL changes to all files and folder names

- replace **causaliq-repo-template** with **causaliq-newcapability** in all files (54 changes across 18 files)
- replace **causaliq_repo_template** with **causaliq_newcapability** in all files (16 changes across 6 files)
- replace **cqcrt** with **cqwxyz** in all files (5 changes in 5 files) where "wxyz" is some suggestive three/four-letter short form of "newcapability", e.g. "flow" for "workflow", "alys" for "analysis. "cqwxyz" will be the the CLI shortform name.
- rename folder **src/causaliq_repo_template** to **src/causaliq_newcapability**
- manually modify the description in **src/causaliq_newcapability/\_\_init\_\_.py**
- manually delete the **src/causaliq-repo-template.egg-info** package file
- manually delete all folders under venv (which will contain references to the causaliq-repo-template)
- manually modify the description in pyproject.toml to reflect the new capability
- manually update README.md to describe the new capability
- manually update the documentation files to refer to new capability

⚠️ **Important**: Make sure to use underscores for Python package names (`causaliq_newcapability`) and hyphens for repo names (`causaliq-newcapability`)

### Check newly named package works OK and commit to GitHub

- Remove and re-setup the virtual environments again (which will then contain the package causaliq-newcapability), and activate the default Pyhton virtual environment

```text
scripts/setup-env -Install
scripts/activate
```

Check the causaliq-newcapability command runs, that all CI checks pass with the new
package name, and that mkdocs for the renamed package can be served.

```text
causaliq-newcapability --help
scripts/check_ci
mkdocs serve
```
This should all work without any errors and the mkdocs should refer to causaliq-newcapability
rather than causaliq-repo-template.

This confirms that the package name has been successfully changed to "causaliq-newcapability". These changes can be commited to the new repo with message "refactor: package name changed to causaliq-newcapability"
